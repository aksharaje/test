# Product Studio: Enterprise License Sales Strategy

## Positioning Statement

> **"Product Studio is the AI-powered operating system for product teams—automating the tedious, amplifying human judgment, and turning every PM into a 10x product leader."**

---

## Target Buyer Personas

| Role | Pain Points | Buying Trigger |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **VP/Director of Product** | Inconsistent PM output, scaling challenges | "We need to standardize how we do product" |
| **CTO/CPO** | Time-to-market pressure, tooling sprawl | "We're drowning in tools but nothing connects" |
| **Transformation Leaders** | Modernizing from spreadsheets | "Our competition is moving faster" |

---

## Value Proposition

### Primary: Time & Cost Savings

| Task | Without Product Studio | With Product Studio |
|------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Write a PRD | 4-8 hours | 15 minutes |
| Build a business case | 2 weeks | 1 day |
| Create aligned OKRs | Manual, error-prone | AI-generated, strategy-aligned |
| Manage PM artifacts | Scattered across tools | Single source of truth |

**Headline metric:** *"40-60% reduction in PM administrative work"*

### Secondary: Consistency & Quality at Scale

- Every PRD follows best practices
- OKRs automatically aligned to company goals
- Releases assessed with objective readiness scores
- Junior PMs produce senior-quality work

### Tertiary: Integration with Existing Workflow

- Bi-directional sync with Jira & Azure DevOps
- Pulls from existing knowledge bases
- Pushes stories directly to backlog

---

## Competitive Differentiation

| Competitor | Their Focus | Product Studio Edge |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Productboard** | Feedback management | Full lifecycle, AI-native |
| **Aha!** | Roadmapping | Strategy → Code pipeline |
| **Notion AI** | Generic docs | Purpose-built for product |
| **Jira** | Issue tracking | Strategic layer on top |

**Key message:** *"Others do pieces. We do the whole job."*
