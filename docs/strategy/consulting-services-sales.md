# Product Studio: Consulting Services Strategy

## Positioning Statement

> **"Our Product Studio-powered consultants deliver 3x the output of traditional PMs—combining elite human expertise with AI acceleration. You're not just getting people, you're getting a force multiplier."**

---

## The Differentiation Problem

Every consulting firm claims to have great PMs. Clients can't tell the difference until engagement is underway. **Product Studio makes your consultants provably better.**

---

## Value Proposition

### 1. Velocity Multiplier (Proof of Differentiation)

- Consultants produce complete PRDs in hours, not weeks
- Aligned OKRs and measurement frameworks are standard deliverables
- Dashboard metrics ("Hours Reclaimed") become your proof point

### 2. Methodology Built In

- Clients get **encoded best practices**, not tribal knowledge
- Software-enforced consistency across all consultants
- Every deliverable passes through AI quality checks

### 3. Knowledge Capture & Transfer

- When engagement ends, client keeps Product Studio instance with all artifacts
- Knowledge Base feature ensures nothing is lost
- *"We don't create dependency—we create capability"*

## Competitive Positioning vs. Traditional Consultancies

| Metric | Traditional Consultancy | Product Studio-Powered |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| PRD turnaround | 2-3 weeks | 2-3 days |
| Artifacts format | Word docs, scattered | Lives in Product Studio |
| Knowledge transfer | Tribal, undocumented | Encoded in platform |
| Junior talent scaling | Expensive mentorship | AI-assisted, consistent |
| Proof of value | Subjective | Dashboard shows hours saved |

**Key pitch:** *"You're not paying for hours. You're paying for outcomes—and we can prove it."*
