# Embedding Tool

## Overview
The Embedding Tool helps you analyze and extract meaningful insights from text data to enhance decision-making and improve product strategies.

## Key Capabilities
- Generate embeddings for text analysis
- Split text into manageable chunks
- Estimate token count for text data
- Create embeddings for specific queries

## How to Use
To start using the Embedding Tool, begin by entering your text data and selecting the desired analysis method. You can then generate embeddings for the entire text or specific queries to gain deeper insights.

## Configuration & Fields
- **Text**: Input text for analysis
  - **What it's for**: Provides the text data to be processed.
  - **Example**: Analyzing customer reviews to understand sentiment.

- **Chunk Size**: Size of text chunks
  - **What it's for**: Determines the length of each text segment for analysis.
  - **Example**: Splitting a long article into smaller sections for analysis.

- **Chunk Overlap**: Overlap between text chunks
  - **What it's for**: Controls the overlap between consecutive text chunks.
  - **Example**: Ensuring context continuity when splitting text into chunks.

- **Model**: Embedding model selection
  - **What it's for**: Specifies the model used to generate embeddings.
  - **Example**: Choosing a model optimized for sentiment analysis.

- **Dimensions**: Number of dimensions for embeddings
  - **What it's for**: Defines the dimensionality of the generated embeddings.
  - **Example**: Selecting a higher dimensionality for more detailed analysis.

- **Query**: Specific query for embedding generation
  - **What it's for**: Generates embeddings tailored to a particular query.
  - **Example**: Creating embeddings for a specific product feature.
