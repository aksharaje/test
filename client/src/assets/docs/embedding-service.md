# Embedding Generator

## Overview
The Embedding Generator helps Product Managers analyze and understand the textual content by converting it into numerical representations, enabling better decision-making based on text similarities and patterns.

## Key Capabilities
- Generate embeddings for a list of texts
- Split text into manageable chunks
- Estimate token count for text analysis
- Generate a single embedding for a specific query

## How to Use
To leverage the Embedding Generator, start by inputting a list of texts you want to analyze. The tool will then generate numerical representations (embeddings) for these texts, allowing you to compare and analyze them based on similarities and patterns. Additionally, you can split lengthy text into smaller, more manageable chunks for detailed analysis and estimate the token count for better understanding of the text's complexity.

## Configuration & Fields
- **Text**: The text you want to analyze
  - **What it's for**: Input the textual content you wish to convert into numerical representations.
  - **Example**: Analyzing customer reviews to identify common themes.

- **Chunk Size**: Size of each text chunk
  - **What it's for**: Specify the length of individual text segments for detailed analysis.
  - **Example**: Breaking down a long article into smaller sections for in-depth examination.

- **Chunk Overlap**: Overlap between text chunks
  - **What it's for**: Determine the overlap between consecutive text segments for comprehensive analysis.
  - **Example**: Ensuring continuity in analysis by overlapping adjacent text chunks.

- **Model**: The model used for generating embeddings
  - **What it's for**: Select the algorithm or technique for converting text to numerical representations.
  - **Example**: Choosing a specific model for sentiment analysis of customer feedback.

- **Dimensions**: Number of dimensions for the generated embeddings
  - **What it's for**: Define the complexity or detail level of the numerical representations.
  - **Example**: Setting the dimensions for analyzing text similarity in product descriptions.
