# Business Case Analysis

## Overview

## Key Capabilities

## How to Use
To start, create a new business case session to define your project scope and objectives. Provide essential details such as business context, target market, and any related feasibility session information. Once the session is created, you can update cost and benefit items based on your analysis, view detailed session information, and manage rate assumptions for financial forecasting. If needed, you can also save user corrections for future reference and run the business case pipeline to leverage AI insights for a holistic evaluation.
