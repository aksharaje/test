# Optimized Flow Manager

## Overview
The Optimized Flow Manager helps Product Managers enhance and refine their product flows for better user engagement and conversion rates. It enables PMs to optimize content prompts, analyze flow performance, and conduct split tests to drive product improvements.

## Key Capabilities
- Create optimized prompts for product flows
- Analyze flow statistics and feedback
- Activate specific versions of product flows
- Initiate split tests to compare different versions

## How to Use
To start optimizing your flows, begin by saving an optimized prompt for a specific flow. Then, use the provided tools to analyze flow details, gather feedback, and activate different versions. Lastly, create split tests to compare the performance of various flow versions.

## Configuration & Fields
- **Session Reference**: Used to identify the work session context for flow optimization.
  - **Purpose**: Provides a reference point for the session in which optimizations are made.
  - **Example**: "Product Launch Campaign Meeting"

- **Flow ID**: Unique identifier for the product flow being optimized.
  - **Purpose**: Specifies the flow to which optimizations apply.
  - **Example**: "Onboarding Flow A"

- **Optimized Prompt**: Customized content to enhance user interaction within the flow.
  - **Purpose**: Improves user engagement and guides users through the flow.
  - **Example**: "Craft a compelling call-to-action message."

- **Version ID**: Numerical identifier for different versions of a flow.
  - **Purpose**: Allows for the selection and activation of specific flow versions.
  - **Example**: "Version 2"

- **Split Test Name**: Name given to the split test comparison.
  - **Purpose**: Identifies the split test for tracking and analysis.
  - **Example**: "A/B Test - New Onboarding Flow"

By utilizing these fields, Product Managers can effectively optimize their product flows to drive better user experiences and achieve higher conversion rates.
